# [Career Compass](https://careercompass-0z1a.onrender.com/)
Career Compass is a web app that helps you keep a record of every position you apply for, the corresponding company details (i.e. location, application date, and job type), and the current status of your application. You can also add notes specific to each job application. I am continually adding new features to the app, however, it is available for public use and is hosted for free on render.com. 

### Motivation
Applying for a job is always a pain and I often found myself trying to keep track of my applications in some sort of poorly managed excel sheet or, even worse, tracking details in a notebook, by hand :woman_facepalming:. 

This presented a great opportunity for me to make a web app that helps me keep track of the positions I've applied for. More importantly I am now able to provide myself (and other users) some data readouts about how many applications I have pending, how many have resulted in interviews or offers, and how many applications have been declined.    

### Quick Start
The following commands will help get you set up after you fork or clone the project:
- `npm run setup-project` installs all necessary packages in the backend and frontend.
- `npm run dev` concurrently runs the backend and frontend as you're in developement. 
- `npm run setup-production-app` allows you to push your own production build

If you're interested in knowing what these commands are actually doing and how they are set up then take a peek at the package.json file in the root folder. Alternatively, if you want to use the app or see how it works you can visit the link in the descrirption (hosted publicly on render.com).
